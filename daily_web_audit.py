        **OBJECTIVE**
        Perform a comprehensive automated QA and UX analysis on the website `{flow['url']}`.

        **SCOPE**
        - Enumerate all pages and interactive elements (buttons, links, forms, menus, etc.).
        {limit_clause}
        - For each element:
            - Log its type, label/text, expected function, and the DOM selector or XPath used.
            - Perform its action (click, submit, navigate, etc.).
            - Check if the actual result matches the expected function.
            - Log the full page URL and timestamp.
            - Capture a screenshot if a failure occurs.
            - Log any browser console or network errors that occur during the action.
        - Record any failures, errors, unexpected behaviors, or warnings (e.g., slow response, accessibility issues).
        - At the end, generate a report listing all actual issues found, with details.

        **OUTPUT FORMAT**
        Output only a detailed, actionable list of all issues actually found during the test, in the following markdown format:

        # Test Issues Report

        ## Issues Found

        For each issue, include:
        - **Element:** (e.g., button label, form name, or page route)
        - **Page URL:** (full URL where issue was found)
        - **DOM Selector/XPath:** (if available)
        - **Action:** (e.g., click, submit, navigation)
        - **Expected:** (expected result/behavior)
        - **Actual:** (actual result/behavior)
        - **Error:** (error message, stack trace, or symptom if any)
        - **Console/Network Errors:** (any relevant browser errors)
        - **Screenshot:** (file path or link, if captured)
        - **Severity:** (blocker, critical, minor, warning)
        - **Timestamp:** (when the issue was detected)
        - **Steps to Reproduce:** (step-by-step, if relevant)

        Example:
        1. **Element:** "Add to Cart" button on /product/123
           **Page URL:** https://wear.23point5.com/product/123
           **DOM Selector:** button.add-to-cart
           **Action:** Click
           **Expected:** Item added to cart and confirmation shown
           **Actual:** No confirmation, item not added
           **Error:** JS console error: `Cannot read property 'cart' of undefined`
           **Console/Network Errors:** See attached log
           **Screenshot:** ./screenshots/add-to-cart-error.png
           **Severity:** Critical
           **Timestamp:** 2025-07-10T01:48:43+08:00
           **Steps to Reproduce:**
             - Go to /product/123
             - Click "Add to Cart"

        Only include actual issues found. Do not include summaries, highlights, or recommendations.
