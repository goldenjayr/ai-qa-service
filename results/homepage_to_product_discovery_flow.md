Overall Summary: The website provides a visually engaging and straightforward path for users to discover and view products, but the experience could be enhanced with more robust filtering options and clearer navigation cues.

Positive Highlights:
*   Clear and visually appealing homepage with prominent calls-to-action ("Shop Now").
*   Product listing page is well-organized with large, high-quality product images.
*   The transition from listing to product detail page is fast and seamless.

Key Friction Points:
*   The filter functionality is quite basic, lacking options for size, color, or specific product types, which hinders efficient product discovery.
*   No breadcrumb navigation makes it difficult for users to understand their location within the site's structure or easily navigate back to previous pages.

Actionable Recommendations:
*   Enhance the filtering system with more granular options like size, color, style, and collection/brand to improve product discovery.
*   Implement breadcrumb navigation to help users understand their location on the site and easily navigate back to previous categories.
*   Consider adding a "Quick View" feature that opens a modal with key product details and an "Add to Cart" button directly from the listing page.
