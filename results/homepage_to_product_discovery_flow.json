    "analysis": "Overall Summary: The website provides a visually engaging and straightforward path for users to discover and view products, but the experience could be enhanced with more robust filtering options and clearer navigation cues.\n\nPositive Highlights:\n*   Clear and visually appealing homepage with prominent calls-to-action (\"Shop Now\").\n*   Product listing page is well-organized with large, high-quality product images.\n*   The transition from listing to product detail page is fast and seamless.\n\nKey Friction Points:\n*   The filter functionality is quite basic, lacking options for size, color, or specific product types, which hinders efficient product discovery.\n*   No breadcrumb navigation makes it difficult for users to understand their location within the site's structure or easily navigate back to previous pages.\n\nActionable Recommendations:\n*   Enhance the filtering system with more granular options like size, color, style, and collection/brand to improve product discovery.\n*   Implement breadcrumb navigation to help users understand their location on the site and easily navigate back to previous categories.\n*   Consider adding a \"Quick View\" feature that opens a modal with key product details and an \"Add to Cart\" button directly from the listing page."
