    "analysis": "Overall Summary: The checkout flow is generally smooth and follows a standard, user-friendly Shopify pattern. However, minor friction points around modal interactions and form submissions could be improved to enhance the experience.\n\nPositive Highlights:\n* The 'Shop Now' call-to-action is clear and prominent on the homepage.\n* Adding an item to the cart triggers a convenient side-drawer, allowing for quick review without leaving the product page.\n* The multi-step checkout process is clearly labeled (Information > Shipping > Payment), guiding the user effectively.\n* Address auto-suggestions help expedite the form-filling process.\n\nKey Friction Points:\n* The close button on the cart side-drawer was not interactable, forcing a specific path ('View cart') rather than allowing the user to simply close the modal and continue shopping.\n* The page unexpectedly refreshed after entering a shipping address, which can be slightly jarring for the user.\n* Payment-related error messages only appeared after attempting to submit, rather than providing real-time validation.\n\nActionable Recommendations:\n* **Improve Modal Interactivity:** Ensure that all interactive elements within modals, such as the 'close' button on the cart drawer, are fully functional and have an adequate click target to prevent user frustration.\n* **Optimize Form Submissions:** Prevent the full-page refresh upon address submission to create a more seamless and less disruptive user experience.\n* **Implement Real-Time Validation:** Add real-time validation to the payment fields to provide immediate feedback, helping users correct errors instantly and reducing the likelihood of failed transactions."
