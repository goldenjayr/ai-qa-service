    "aiSummary": "The website is stable and core functionalities are working as expected. Key user flows from homepage to product details are smooth and without errors.",
    "positiveHighlights": "- **Clean and Visually Appealing UI:** The site has a modern and minimalist design, which enhances the shopping experience.\n- **Clear Navigation:** The main navigation is intuitive, with categories like 'Brands', 'Artists', and 'Products' making it easy for users to find what they're looking for.\n- **High-Quality Product Imagery:** The product photos are high-resolution and showcase the items effectively.\n- **Helpful Sizing Tools:** The inclusion of an 'AI Size Assistant' and a 'Size Guide' is a great feature to help customers choose the right fit, potentially reducing returns.",
    "frictionPoints": "- **Intrusive Pop-ups:** The initial pop-ups for currency selection and cart notifications can be slightly disruptive to the user's browsing flow.\n- **Default Collapsed Information:** Important details under 'PRODUCT INFORMATION' and 'OVERSIZED FIT' are hidden within collapsed accordions, which users might not open.\n- **Lack of 'Quick View':** Users have to navigate to the product detail page for every item they are interested in, which can be time-consuming.",
    "recommendations": "- **Implement a 'Quick View' Feature:** Add a quick view option on the product listing page to allow users to see essential product details and add items to their cart without leaving the listing page. This will streamline the browsing process.\n- **Expose Key Information by Default:** Consider having the 'PRODUCT INFORMATION' section expanded by default on product pages, or use a tabbed layout to make this information more readily accessible.\n- **Consolidate Header Elements:** To reduce visual clutter, some of the social media icons in the header could be grouped under a single 'Follow Us' dropdown or moved to the footer."
